# CodeTrieCache
A robust caching library for real-time code suggestion generation, built around a trie data structure. It offers lightning-fast key matching (O(1)) to validate user input against generated suggestions, with support for backtracking, multi-branch suggestions from multiple models, and efficient handling of code edits.
